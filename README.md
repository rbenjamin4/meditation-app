# Quiet Soul Meditation App

## Description

Quiet Soul is a meditation app, offering a library of different meditations for users to choose from. As the user listens to the meditations they choose, the apps log the amount of time they've meditated. On the profile page, the user can update and save their information, including a weekly meditation goal. The app will track the progress the user makes, comparing the amount of time they've meditated with their goal. The app also allows the user to delete their account.
